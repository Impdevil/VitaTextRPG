I want to have Dungeons stored within an sqlite database.
Each dungeon has a set of rooms, each room must have a single door, these doors will connect at 
least one way with another room. Some rooms have features which door inherits from, these objects
can be hidden or have a certain skill level required to find them


Rooms have a description, an inspection description, a name, an id, at least one door if not more.
rooms can have features but not always, features have a description and inspection description, 
a name, and id, these might also have certian triggers as well.
Doors have at least 1 room they connect to, they have a description, inspection description, 
can be hidden, can be locked and or require certian items inorder to be unlocked, they can 
also act as triggers.
a feature might contain items, and if the items are found they need to be able to be tracked seperately, 
like if they are still in the room they dont need to be tracked but if they have been moved, picked up into 
the players inventory or are placed in a different location. 

inspecting a room might reveal a hidden feature that can be found with the room.
